    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4>

    <p class="even"><strong>XoopsCare</strong> is a module to help you to maintain your website easily and <b>automatically</b>.
        <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h4 class="odd">Install/uninstall</h4>

    <p class="even">No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process â€“
        extract the module folder into the ../modules directory. Install the
        module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules.<br><br>
        Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the
        <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/xoops/xoops-operations-guide/" target="_blank">Chapter 2.12 of our XOOPS Operations Manual</a></p>


    <h4 class="odd">Operating instructions</h4>

    With the module you can :<br><br>
    1/ Maintain your database<br>
    2/ Run you own queries<br>
    3/ Execute Php code<br>
    4/ Clean templates_c and cache folders<br>
    5/ Remove spammed comments<br>
    6/ Clean sessions<br><br>

    For each of this actions, you can define if you want to do it or not and when to do it (you can schedule it).<br><br>

    Additionally, you can log all the actions made by the module and (if you have them), use CRONs to maintain you site.<br><br>

    If you have the possibility to call the module with a CRON, then simply call the file named <i>cron.php</i> present
    at the module's root and pass it a password you have typed in the module's administration.<br>
    Do it like this : http://www.example.com/modules/xoopscare/cron.php?password=mypassword
    <b>If you use a cron and don't type a password, the module will not do anything</b>, this is just to protect
    your site from people who could use it.

    If you don't have the possibility to use a CRON then activate the module's block somewhere on your site (where
    you want), and the module will automatically and when it's necessary, do the tasks you scheduled.
    <br> Tip : You can use a cache on the block.<br><br>

    The first thing to do is to go in the module's administration and to set the preferences.
    <br> In the first part <b>General Preferences</b>, set the CRON password if you use CRON.
    <br> If you want to create a log file, then fill the zone called <i>Log File</i>.
    <br> Note, it is recommended, for security reasons, to give this filename a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">.php</span> extension.<br><br>

    In the part called <b>Database Maintenance</b>, type a delay in days to maintain your database.
    <br> If you set this delay to 0 then nothing will be done.
    <br> The process of this action is to check, repair, analyse and optimize all the tables used by your Xoops site.<br><br>


    In the part called <b>Queries</b>, first type an execution's delay then (but only if you need it), type some
    SQL queries to run against your database.<br>
    <br> Note, the module does not apply anything to your queries, it takes them one by one and execute it.<br><br>

    You can do the same thing than in the previous point but to execute some Php code in the part called <b>Php code</b><br><br>

    The part called <b>Cache and Templates_c</b> gives you the possibility to clean the cache and templates_c folder
    (folders at the root of your site)<br><br>

    The <b>Sessions</b> part will give you the possibility to clean your Mysql session's table at a given delay.<br><br>


    Finally, with the part called <b>Spammed comments</b>, you can remove all the spam from your comments.<br>
    This functionality of the module runs with the Xoops <i>Word Censoring Options</i>.<br>
    First, from the <i>Site Preferences</i>, you must Enable censoring of unwanted words, type some words to censor and
    select a word to replace with.<br>
    By default, censored words are replaced by #OOPS#.<br>
    The XoopsCare module will search for comments containing this replacement in the comment's titles and/or comment's content
    and will apply your preferences on this comments.<br>
    Additionally, the module can extract the spammer's IPs (from the comments) and automatically add their IPs to your ban list.<br>
    Finally, you can select what to do with the comments detected as SPAM, you can keep them, unpublish them, hide them and
    delete them. <br><br>

    If you use a CRON to clean your site, then the delay entered for each action is not used but this delay must be greater than 0.<br><br>

    Detailed instructions on configuring the access rights for user groups are available in the
